**Objectives for AI applications**

1. Be socially beneficial. 
2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
3. Be built and tested for safety.
4. Be accountable to people.
5. Incorporate privacy design principles.
6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
7. Be made available for uses that accord with these principles.  

**AI applications we will not pursue**

In addition to the above objectives, we will not design or deploy AI in the following application areas:


* Technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.  Where there is a material risk of harm, we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks, and will incorporate appropriate safety constraints.

* Weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.

* Technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.

* Technologies whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.
