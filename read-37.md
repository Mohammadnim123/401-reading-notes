# React Introduction
React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces.

Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used code in the world, powering Facebook and Instagram among many, many other software companies.

Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state in any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of components.

React is used to build single-page web applications, among with many other libraries and frameworks that were available before React came into life.

**Why JSX?**

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages


**React Advantages**

Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.

Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.

Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.

**React Limitations**

Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.

Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.
