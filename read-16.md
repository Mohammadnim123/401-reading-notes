# Data Science Primer

This data science primer will cover exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and model training. As you can see, those chunks make up 80% of the pie. They also set the foundation for more advanced techniques.

## chapter_1

Machine learning is not about algorithms.

Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...


Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

**Model** - a set of patterns learned from data.

**Algorithm** - a specific ML process used to train a model.

**Training data** - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

**Test data** - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

**Features** - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

**Target variable** - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

**Observations** - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

**Machine Learning Tasks**

Academic machine learning starts with and focuses on individual algorithms. However, in applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job.

* A task is a specific objective for your algorithms.

* Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.

* In fact, you should always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.

>The two most common categories of tasks are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

## chapter_2

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

The purpose of exploratory analysis is to "get to know" the dataset. Doing so upfront will make the rest of the project much smoother, in 3 main ways:

You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).

You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).

You’ll get a "feel" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.

## chapter_3

>Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

>Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

>However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.

## chapter_4

Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

In general, you can think of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.

This is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for 3 big reasons:

You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.

You can bring in your own domain expertise.

Most importantly, once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise!

## chapter_5

At its most basic, machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing ‘intelligence’ over time.


## chapter_6

It might seem like it took us a while to get here, but professional data scientists actually spend the bulk of their time on the steps leading up to this one:

Exploring the data.

Cleaning the data.

Engineering new features
