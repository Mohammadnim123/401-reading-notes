# List Comprehensions in Python

**List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.**

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses.

The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.

The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’, square brackets, to help you remember that the
result is going to be a list.

**new_list**
The new list (result).

**expression(i)**
Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.

**for i in old_list**
The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the
old list.

**if filter(i)**
Apply a filter with an If-statement.
