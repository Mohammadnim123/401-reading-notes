# Docker
Docker : which is a way to isolate and run entire applications. With Docker it doesn’t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore. The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more.

With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. Wins all around.

>Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

in recent years Linux containers, also known as “containerization,” has become increasingly popular. For most applications, a virtual machine provides far more resources than are needed and a container is more than sufficient.

>This, fundamentally, is what Docker is. A way to implement Linux containers!

An analogy we can use here is that of homes and apartments. Virtual Machines are like homes: stand-alone buildings with their own infrastructure including plumbing and heating, as well as a kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and so on. Docker containers are like apartments: they share common infrastructure like plumbing and heating, but come in various sizes that match the exact needs of an owner.

# ontainers vs Virtual Environments

If you are a Python programmer (like me) a common question at this point is, what about virtual environments? How do they differ from containers?

Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally. We can create an isolated box for individual projects so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer. Virtual environments are great.

But…virtual environments can only isolate Python packages. They still rely on a global, system-level installation of Python albeit they can refer to the proper version. So when we use Python 2.7 in a project, we’re pointing to an installation of Python 2.7 on the computer itself, not actually within the virtual environment.

Also we can’t run a production database or other services within virtual environments so compared to Docker containers they are far more limited.

**Conclusion:**

* Docker is a way to run Linux containers
* Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
* Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
* Images are made up of one or more layers
* Containers are a running instance of an image
* docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
* Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases
