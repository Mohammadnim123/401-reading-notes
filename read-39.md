# React Router

To get started with React Router in a web app, you’ll need a React web app. If you need to create one, we recommend you try Create React App. It’s a popular tool that works really well with React Router.

Installation
You can install React Router from the public npm registry with either npm or yarn. Since we’re building a web app, we’ll use react-router-dom in this guide.
```
npm install react-router-dom

```

Next, copy/paste either of the following examples into src/App.js.

# React - Styling FAQ

CSS-in-JS refers to a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files.

Note that this functionality is not a part of React, but provided by third-party libraries. React does not have an opinion about how styles are defined; if in doubt, a good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to them using className.

# NextJs

**To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:**

* Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
* You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
* You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
* You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

Enter Next.js, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.
