# Pain vs. Suffering

![ff](https://apathappears.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/know-your-status.jpg)

The pain that you’ll experience during this course is no exception; most times it won’t feel good. You won’t feel good.

>That price is pain, the pain of growth

All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.


Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do. Research! Build your resources and your community! Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.

It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. Live it, love it, and take it forward into your future as a full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart.

# Big O Notation

A beginner's guide to Big O notation
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

**O(1)**

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

**O(n)**

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

**O(n^2)**

O(N^2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.

**O(2^n)**

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.

**O(log N)**

Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.
