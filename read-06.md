# How to use Random Module

**In this post, I would like to describe the usage of the random module in Python. The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.**

**When to use it?**
We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

**Random functions**

* Randint : If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

* Choice : Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

* Shuffle : The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

* Randrange : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).

# What is Risk Analysis

**The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.**

>In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

**Now, you might think what could be the possible risks that you could encounter? Well here is a list:**

* Use of new hardware

* Use of new technology

* Use of new automation tool

* The sequence of code

* Availability of test resources for the application

**Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:**

* The time that you allocated for testing.

* A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application.

* Urgency from the clients to deliver the project.

* Incomplete requirements.


**In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:**

* Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting.

* Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas.

* Create a Risk Assessment database for future use.

* Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

>In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically.

**Effect** – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

**Cause** – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

**Likelihood** – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.
